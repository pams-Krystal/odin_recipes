        <h3>How to make really tasty Jollof Rice With Chicken!</h3>
        <p>I love how this recipe makes a complete meal with rice, chicken and veggies! It is incredibly flavorful and works well for dinner or entertaining.</p>

        
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>15-20 garlic cloves peeled</li>
    <li>3 inch ginger root peeled and sliced into chunks</li>
    <li>4 pounds chicken drumsticks and thighs about 2kg</li>
    <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    <li>2 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>6 large roma tomatoes</li>
    <li>16 -17 oz tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>6 cups jasmine rice or other long grain rice</li>
    <li>½ cup diced/sliced carrots</li>
    <li>½ cup diced/sliced green beans</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Blend the spices. Place the garlic and ginger into a blender. Add about a quarter cup of water. Blend into a paste.</li>
    <li>Season the chicken. Place the chicken into a pot. Add in about one quarter of the diced onion. 
        Add in two tablespoons of the blended garlic and ginger, half teaspoon of the white pepper, one and a half teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder. Toss everything to combine.</li>
    <li>Cook the chicken. Add 3 cups of water to the chicken. Bring to a boil on high heat then let it simmer on medium heat for about 18 minutes</li>
    <li>Cook the tomatoes. Add fresh tomatoes to blender and blend to a paste. Do not add water while blending. Pour the blended tomatoes into a medium saucepan. Let it cook on medium heat for 20 minutes until the tomatoes shrink. Do not stir while the tomatoes cook down.</li>
    <li>Prep chicken for frying. Remove the chicken from its stock using a frying spoon and place in a colander to drain. Reserve the stock.</li>
    <li><strong>Note:</strong> I reserved two cups of stock.</li>
    <li>Fry chicken. Place oil in a frying pan up to 2 inches. Let the oil heat up then add the chicken to the oil and fry until golden brown. When one side turns golden, flip to the other side.</li>
    <li>Remove fried chicken and place on paper towel to absorb the excess oil. Let the oil cool down then take out out one cup of oil to cook the rice.</li>
    <li>Make the sauce for the rice. Place one cup of the oil used in frying the chicken into a non-stick or heavy bottom pot. Let the oil heat up then add the remaining onions. Sauté for two minutes while stirring from time to time until the onions are fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked-down tomatoes to the pot and cook while stirring for about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the tomato sauce and cook while stirring from time to time until the sauce shrinks and starts sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
    <li>Add in the one teaspoon of dried thyme and stir so it releases its flavor.</li>
    <li>Add in the remaining blended garlic and ginger. Stir well and let it cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Wash rice. Wash the rice 3-4 times to remove the excess starch.</li>
    <li>Add rice to pot. Add the washed rice to the pot with tomato sauce. Stir well to combine.</li>
    <li>Add in the reserved 2 cups of chicken stock, the remaining one teaspoon of salt, two teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder, half teaspoon of white pepper and 2 bay leaves. Stir everything to combine.</li>
    <li>Add in two cups of water. Cover the pot tightly with a large sheet of aluminum foil (this will help trap the steam into the pot). lace the lead on the pot and reduce the heat to low.</li>
    <li>Cook rice on low. Let the rice cook on low heat for 20 minutes. Open the pot and gently stir the rice being careful not to break the grains.</li>
    <li>Cover the rice again with aluminum foil and the place the lid of the pot on the aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Let the rice cook on low heat for another 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add carrots and green beans. Open the pot and add the diced carrots and green beans. Cover and let the veggies cook with the rice for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Fluff and serve. Remove bay leaves, fluff rice with a fork and serve with the fried chicken. You could serve with an additional salad if you so desire.</li>
